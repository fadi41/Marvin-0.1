Agreed that saving the System Instructions is key, and conceptualized a user-managed 'conscience file' (initially JSON) to store interaction summaries for context in future sessions. Drafted instructions for this file concept, recommended platforms, and generated this initial JSON log entry. Clarified that the AI generates the text, but the user must save the file.",
